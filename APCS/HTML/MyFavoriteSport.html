		<P>My favorite sport is track and field. I started running track in middle school and I have liked it a lot ever since then.
		I run the 100m, 200m, and participate in long jump. I hope to attend a college where I can run track but at the same time
		focus on my studies. Also, I am only writing this because I do not know what to say so bye.</P>
		
		<P> Oh look at that <B>I am back AGAIN<B> but I do not plan on staying for long. Hopefully I can go to school in the LA area
		I like LA a lot. I do not particularly know why but I just do. My dream school as of right now is <I>USC<I>. Alrighty well
		I am bored now so bye.</P>
