This is a game created by Chibuikem Ohanele that utilizes two data structures Binary Trees and Stacks. The purpose of the game is to create a random maze and then allow a user to move throughout the game to find the largest value within the maze. The maze is represented my a binary tree and the users moves will be stored using a stack. The reason for the use of the stack is if the user reaches a deadend in which case they will move back to where they came from. This example is the reason I am using a stack because of its LIFO qualities.
